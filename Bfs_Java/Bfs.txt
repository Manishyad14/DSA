#Breadth first search for graph---->>
-->The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a graph data structure
 for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the root of the graph and visits all 
nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
-->To avoid processing a node more than once, we divide the vertices into two categories:

1>Visited and
2>Not visited.
3>Bfs uses for queue data structure for the traversal in the graphs.

#How does BFS work?
-->Starting from the root, all the nodes at a particular level are visited first and
 then the nodes of the next level are traversed till all the nodes are visited.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-->To do this a queue is used. All the adjacent unvisited nodes of the current
 level are pushed into the queue and the nodes of the current level
 are marked visited and popped from the queue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->first we have to insert the element into the queue then into the visisted array--->>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time-complexity - O(V+E)- vertices + edges is the tc of bfs
Space comlexity  - O(V) - vertices
